### He Went to Paris

By Jimmy Buffett

He went to Paris looking for answers   
To questions that bothered him so   
He was impressive, young and aggressive  
Saving the world on his own  
But the warm Summer breezes  
The French wines and cheeses  
Put his ambition at bay  
And Summers and Winters  
Scattered like splinters  
And four or five years slipped away  

Then he went to England, played the piano  
And married an actress named Kim  
They had a fine life, she was a good wife  
And bore him a young son named Jim  
And all of the answers and all of the questions  
He locked in his attic one day    
'Cause he liked the quiet clean country  living     
And twenty more years slipped away

Well the war took his baby, the bombs killed his lady  
And left him with only one eye    
His body was battered, his world was shattered   
And all he could do was just cry  
While the tears were falling, he was recalling    
The answers he never found  
So he hopped on a freighter, skidded the ocean     
And left England without a sound  

Now he lives in the islands, fishes the pilin's
And drinks his green label each day  
He's writing his memoirs and losing his hearing  
But he don't care what most people say  
Through eighty-six years of perpetual motion  
If he likes you he'll smile then he'll say  
Jimmy, some of it's magic, some of it's tragic  
But I had a good life all the way  

And he went to Paris looking for answers  
To questions that bother him so
