### Partners, Brothers and Friends

By The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band     
     
The promoter says he wants to cancel     
'Cause there ain't enough tickets sold     
The air conditioner on the bus just broke     
And I can't shake this cold     
The single lost the bullet     
The singer's losin' his wife     
Well, I might be crazy but I wouldn't change     
A single thing about this life     
     
Sometimes we feel like champions     
Sometimes we just can't win     
Sometimes our records hit the top of the charts     
Or the discount bargain bins     
Through almost 20 years of touring     
We've remained partners, brothers and friends     
Well, we keep it together 'cause we're sure we're gonna be     
Big time before it all ends     
     
Just as long as Johnny's got his fiddle     
And Jimmy's got his drums along     
Then Jeffrey and me and Bobby will be     
Singing all our favorite songs     
Catch the fire from the folks in the front row     
Fan the flames as the beat gets strong     
It's great to be a part of something so good     
That's lasted so long     
     
Well I saw a story in the paper     
Suddenly the band's big news     
The critics all like our records just fine     
But they seem a bit confused     
Is it folk or rock or country     
Whoa, seems like everybody cares but us     
So just leave us an early wakeup call     
So we don't miss the bus     
     
Just as long as Johnny's got his fiddle     
And Jimmy's got his drums along     
Then Jeffrey and me and Bobby will be     
Singing all our favorite songs     
We'll catch the fire from the folks in the front row     
Fan the flames as the beat gets strong     
It's great to be a part of something so good     
That's lasted so long     
     
The band says it can't stand my latest song     
It's too personal     
But my first wife's second marriage blew up     
They had to get the dang thing annulled     
Well, if that ain't something to sing about     
Well you tell me what is     
And we'll give it a beat and put it on the street     
And we just might have another hit     
     
Just as long as Johnny's got his banjo     
And Jimmie's got his harps along     
Then Jeffrey and me and Bobby will be     
Singing all our favorite songs     
We'll catch the fire from the folks in the front row     
Fan the flames as the beat gets strong     
It's great to be a part of something so good     
That's lasted so long     
Yeah, it's great to be a part of something so good     
That's lasted so long
